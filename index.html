    <h3>Challenges that i face at the coding ground</h3>

 <p class="paragraph"> The first day when i came here at the coding ground, i was 
    so nervous and scared because i didnt know what i was to expact
  and the moment when i saw that the sudents who were also contesting we were so many. That made everything worse knowing that we were
in a competition fighting for the right spot. Then i heard that the bootcamp is for section so not all of us are going to be selected 
so the will only choose the best, then i had to make sure that i become one of the students that they select. It happend that i became 
one of the top ten students that they selected. A week later i received an email for attending bootcamp and thats when i was relieved
that i know for a fact that i'm in. First day of bootcamp i heard that theres two groups and the need to select only five from the then.
Then again i had to fight my way to the top. Wednesday they told us about an intervew that will be held at Tcg coding Ground, held by
Joson, co-owner of the Coding Ground. During interview i was totally defferent person, i was shaking and not knowing how to respond to the
questions they were asking. But in the end i managed to pull through.

            the time that i have realised that i went through freecodecamp but onlu to find out that 
            i have learned nothing. Then i had to start freecodecamp again but still struggling to understand the basics. For once i thought maybe this 
            institution is not meant for me but Now i have realised that the more we do projects, the more we get to understand.
